        <h2>Workshop on Foundations of Computer Security 2021</h2>
        <p>June 21, 2021</p>
        <p>
          Affiliated with <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/CSF2021/cfp.html">CSF 2021</a>

      <h2 id="cfp">Background, aim and scope</h2>
      <p>
        Computer security is an established field of both theoretical and practical
        significance. In recent years, there has been sustained interest in the formal
        foundations of methods used in computer security. The aim of the FCS 2021
        workshop is to provide a forum for the discussion of continued research in this
        area.
      </p>

      <p> FCS 2021 welcomes papers on all topics related to the formal underpinnings of
security and privacy, and their applications. The scope of FCS 2021 includes,
but is not limited to, formal specification, analysis, and design of
cryptographic protocols and their applications; formal definitions of various
aspects of security such as access control mechanisms, mobile code security and
network security; modeling of information flow and its application to
confidentiality policies, system composition, and covert channel analysis;
foundations of privacy; applications of formal techniques to practical security
and privacy.
      </p>

      <p> We are interested in new theoretical results, in exploratory
presentations that examine open questions and raise fundamental concerns about
existing theories, and in the development of security/privacy tools using
formal techniques. Demonstrations of tools based on formal techniques are
welcome, as long as the demonstrations can be carried out on a standard digital
projector (i.e., without any specialized equipment). We solicit the submission
of both mature work and work in progress.
      </p>

            <p>Developing High-Performance Mechanically-Verified Cryptographic Code </p>

            <p>
                Project Everest is constructing a high-performance, standards-compliant,
            formally verified implementation of the HTTPS ecosystem, including TLS, X.509,
            and the core cryptographic algorithms.  This talk will present an overview of
            how we verify our implementations are correct, cryptographically secure, and
            resilient to basic side channels.  We will focus on our EverCrypt cryptographic
            provider, a comprehensive collection of verified, cryptographic functionalities
            (available via a carefully designed API) whose performance matches or exceeds
            the best unverified implementations.  The talk will conclude with lessons
            learned in the process of verifying over 124K lines of code and proof.

            <p>Bio:</p>

            <p>
                Bryan Parno is an Associate Professor with a joint appointment in Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department and Electrical & Computer Engineering Department, and a Senior Member of ACM and IEEE. After receiving a Bachelor's degree from Harvard College, he completed his PhD working with Adrian Perrig at Carnegie Mellon University, where his dissertation won the 2010 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award. He then spent six years as a Researcher in Microsoft Research before returning to CMU.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bryan's research is primarily focused on investigating long-term, fundamental improvements in how to design and build secure systems. In 2011, he was selected for Forbes' 30-Under-30 Science List. He formalized and worked to optimize verifiable computation, receiving a Best Paper Award at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy for his advances. He coauthored a book on Bootstrapping Trust in Modern Computers, and his work in that area has been incorporated into the latest security enhancements in Intel CPUs. His research into security for new application models was incorporated into Windows and received Best Paper Awards at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy and the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation. He has recently extended his interest in bootstrapping trust to the problem of building practical, formally verified secure systems, for which he received two Distinguished Paper Awards. His other research interests include user authentication, secure network protocols, and security in constrained environments (e.g., RFID tags, sensor networks, or vehicles).

      <h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
      <p>

        FCS 2021 welcomes two kinds of submissions:
        </p><ul>
          <li> full papers (at most 12 pages, excluding references and well-marked appendices) </li>
          <li> short papers (at most 1 page, excluding references and well-marked appendices)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>FCS'21 will employ a light form of double-blind reviewing. Submitted papers
         must (a) omit any reference to the authors' names or the names of their
         institutions, and (b) reference the authors' own related work in the third
         person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on
         the work of ..."). Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens
         the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g.,
         important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). The
         author information will be revealed to the reviewers after reviews are
         submitted. Please see the CSF conference site for answers to frequently asked
         questions (FAQ) that address many common concerns. When in doubt, contact the
         program chairs.
      </p>

      <p>
	All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the program committee
	listed below. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that
	their papers will be presented at the workshop. Extended abstracts
	will receive as rigorous a review as full papers. Extended abstracts
	may receive shorter talk slots at the workshop than full
	papers, depending on the number of accepted submissions.
      </p>

      <p>
	 Papers should be formatted using the two-column IEEE
	 proceedings style available for various document preparation
	 systems at the IEEE Conference Publishing Services
	 page <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>.
	 The first page should include the paper's title, an
	 abstract, and a list of keywords. Committee members are not
	 required to read appendices, so papers must be intelligible
	 without them. Papers not adhering to the page limits may be
	 rejected without consideration of their merits.
      </p>

<!--
     <p> Papers must be submitted online in the PDF format through EasyChair,
         at the following address: <a
         href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fcs21">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fcs21</a>.
         Please do not submit papers in any other format (e.g., Word).  </p>
-->
      <h2 id="proceedings">Informal proceedings</h2>
      <p>
        The workshop has no published proceedings. <b>Presenting a paper
        at the workshop should not preclude submission to or
        publication in other venues (before, after or concurrently
        with FCS 2021).</b> Papers presented at the workshop will be made
        available to workshop participants, but this does not
        constitute an official proceedings.
